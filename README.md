# Laplace-Gaussian MMSE Estimator

This repository implements a Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) estimator for a signal corrupted by Gaussian noise, where the original signal follows a Laplace distribution.

## Problem Description

We consider the estimation of a signal X that follows a Laplace distribution, observed through additive Gaussian noise Z. The observed signal Y is modeled as:

Y = X + Z

where:
- X follows a Laplace distribution with σ_X = 1
- Z follows a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and variance σ_Z² = 0.1

## Features

- Implementation of Laplace and Gaussian probability density functions
- Visualization of prior distributions
- Bayesian framework for MMSE estimation
- Numerical computation of posterior distributions
- MMSE estimator computation and visualization

## Dependencies

```
numpy
matplotlib
scipy
```

## Usage

The code provides functions for:
1. Generating probability density functions
2. Computing likelihood and prior distributions
3. Calculating the MMSE estimator
4. Visualizing results

## Installation

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd laplace-gaussian-mmse
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Example Outputs

The code generates several visualizations:
- PDFs of X (Laplace) and Z (Gaussian)
- Posterior distribution numerator for specific y values
- MMSE estimate as a function of y

## Mathematical Background

The MMSE estimator is computed using the Bayesian framework:

x̂(y) = E[X|Y=y] = ∫ x f_{X|Y}(x|y) dx

where f_{X|Y}(x|y) is the posterior distribution derived using Bayes' theorem.
